# NeighborhoodFinder: Landing Page

[Landing Page](https://sa.mcs.marcokaufmann.ch/) | [API](https://api.sa.mcs.marcokaufmann.ch/_/) | [Analytics Dashboard](https://sa-mcs.pirsch.io/)

This is the repository for the landing page MVP of the NeighborhoodFinder. It is based on Astro and uses simple HTML, vanilla JavaScript (when needed), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for rapid prototyping (as we're pretty familiar with using these technologies). To store waitlist entries, we quickly deployed a [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) backend (single file backend) in a few minutes. Furthermore, we added [Pirsch](https://pirsch.io/) (privacy-friendly analytics) to collect basic web analytics.
